# Minute Rush

Minute Rush is a Fabric 26.3 minigame. Everyone receives the same randomly selected task, and the first player to complete it wins the round. The first player to reach 10 round wins takes the match. A round times out after 60 seconds and immediately starts a new task.

## Running

1. Install Java 25.
2. Run `./gradlew build`.
3. Use the generated Fabric server/client run configuration.

Operators can use:

- `/minute-rush start` - start a match (requires at least two players)
- `/minute-rush solo-start` - start an isolated one-player testing match in a singleplayer world
- `/minute-rush solo-exit` - stop singleplayer testing and reset its score
- `/minute-rush skip` - skip the current round (useful while testing)
- `/minute-rush status` - inspect match state
- `/minute-rush reset` - reset the match and scores
- `/minute-rush config score <value>` - set the winning score
- `/minute-rush config duration <seconds>` - set the round timeout

The task catalog now covers placing, collecting, mining, jumping, traveling, sprinting, repeated jumps, hold-item actions, player interaction, mob interaction, and interactable-block interaction. The game avoids the previous three task kinds when the pool has alternatives, so the same task family does not repeat immediately. Singleplayer deliberately excludes the player-player task because it has no second participant; the other task families use the same round lifecycle as multiplayer. Placement tasks no longer require coordinates: place the requested block anywhere, and the game detects the placement from your item-use stat. Tasks use per-player baselines so pre-existing inventory/stat progress does not falsely complete a round. Settings default to 10 points and 60 seconds and can be changed with the config commands.

Every round begins with a short countdown. The task is shown in chat and in a title overlay, and the round winner and score are shown the same way. A sidebar scoreboard displays each player's current match score while a match is running. `/minute-rush solo-start` uses this same countdown, task announcement, timeout, scoring, and reset lifecycle; it only relaxes the normal two-player start requirement.

Singleplayer testing is explicit and does not change normal multiplayer rules. Run `/minute-rush solo-start` as the player, test the tasks normally, and use `/minute-rush solo-exit` to stop. A regular `/minute-rush start` still requires at least two players.

For parity with the older mod, the most useful input is its source repository or a zip containing source, `fabric.mod.json`, Gradle files, resources, data/config files, and any test world. If source is unavailable, provide a decompiled source archive plus configs and screenshots or a short video showing the intended round flow and task behavior. The JAR alone is enough for bytecode inspection, but it cannot reliably recover all labels, resource-driven task data, or intended UX.
